# coronavirus-checker v0.1-alpha
A silly URLLIB program that scans a coronavirus website made so I could I practice using python more. Might make into CLI one day.

# Commands:
/help: shows commands
/cases: shows global cases
/deaths: shows global deaths
/recoveries: shows global recoveries
/mortality: shows mortality rate in %
/store: store data within a text file
/exit: exit the program.

Made by K. Catterall (c) 2020. I say copyright, but I don't care, it's just a random URLLIB program for practicing basic python lol.
